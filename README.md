This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

### Generating gRPC stubs

Run the [generate-grpc.sh script](./generate-grpc.sh) to create gRPC stubs for use in API routes and route handers.

If you encounter an error related to `protoc` not being found, you may need to set up a symlink. Run the following command:

```bash
ln -s /opt/homebrew/opt/protobuf@3/bin/protoc /path/to/your/project/node_modules/grpc-tools/bin/protoc
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
